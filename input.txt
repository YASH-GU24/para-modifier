Indian economy is agriculture based, or we can say that India is an agrarian economy. This is evident from the fact that the national income of India consists of 70% of the income generated from agriculture.

Before independence, the economy was 95% dependent on agriculture and the revenues earned from agriculture.[1] 

It is worthwhile to mention that around 85% of the population was living in villages, and the only means of subsistence was agriculture.

Concerning agriculture, the situation of the Indian economy on the eve of independence was disheartening.

Agriculture, even after being the most important sector, was facing economic deterioration and stagnation in the economy.
